<div class="words">
	<p>Hi, my name is Michael Klarman.  I am a full stack developer with over a decade of experience.  I recently sold my first start-up, Nuts-Nuts-And-More-Nuts, to <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook </a> for ten billion dollars.  Now I practice doing fun exercises like creating a three page website all about me because, really when you are stinking rich, it is pretty boring.  In my down time I am creating my own programming language called LOU.  The great thing about LOU is that when you make simple mistakes, it sends back automated messages in the syntax like 'You are an idiot' or 'Play the Powerball, you have no chance in life.'  </p>

	<p> I am not married, but there are nine different women who do claim I am a father.  Let's assume half of them are correct and that I have four and a half kids.  One of my favorite things to do when I am away from the coding world is to go to fast food restaurants just so I can say 'no' to the cashier when they ask if if I'd like to donate $1 to end world hunger.  I always just throw the food away, in fact last week, I asked a homeless guy if he'd throw the food away for me cause I really had to get to this banquet that was thrown in my honor. </p>
